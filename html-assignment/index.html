        <p>I was born 6<sup>th</sup> of August of the year 1998 in the Philippines. I grew up in a town called Pili. I played basketball and skateboard my whole childhood in the Philippines. I also love playing video games. My two grandmothers basically raised me since my parents were here in Canada. I was in the Philippines until I was 16. </p>
        <p>I moved here to Canada 9 years ago. It was a culture shock at first but I adapted fast. I've met a lot of good people here in Canada and have been influenced possitively. I know how priviledged I am to be here in Canada and I think of myself as a creative that's why I took <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> so that I can possibly get a high paying job and make something of myself. I also have a passion for working out and being healthy. I still love playing video games. My favorite motivational quote is:</p>
